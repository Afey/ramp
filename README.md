ramp - Rapid Machine Learning Prototyping
========

ramp is a python module for rapid prototyping of machine learning
solutions. It is essentially a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
wrapper around various python machine learning and statistics libraries
([scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org), [rpy2](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html), etc.),
providing a simple, declarative syntax for
exploring features, algorithms and transformations quickly and
efficiently.

## TODO
- Docs
- More tests
- Cluster computing support
